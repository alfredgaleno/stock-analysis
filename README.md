# Stock Analysis

## Overview

This Analysis was commissioned to determine what the best stocks Steve, our client, could have his parents invest in. We took raw data on various stocks in both 2017 and 2018 and analyzed their perfomrance forboth years. Despite Steve's parents eagerness to invest in Dairy Queen ("DQ") there are other alternative stocks that would serve as a better investment of their capital.

##Results
In both 2017 and 2018 there were good stocks that would have made a wise investment. In 2017 the majority of stocks in question did well. Even DQ showed a 199.4% return. Other stocks like SEDG, ENPH, and FLSR had great years with over 100% return! (see Fig1) However, in 2018 many of the stocks Steve was looking at lost value, and in 2018 DQ was leading this negative trend at -62.6% return. Only two stocks, ENPH and RUN finished the year in the green (see Fig 2). Depending on the timing of when Steve's parents bought and sold their shares there were many other stocks that could have yielded more promise.

##Summary of Work
While the data found through analyzing these stocks was able to be shared easily via formatted charts, the work to get there was not simple! Refactoring code is a difficult process, and can be challenging when compared to starting from scratch. It required far more attention to detail than writing new code. It was good to have a framework to start working with, but became challenging when having to fill in the gaps and ensure all variables were cohesive. This issue was compounded by the fact that VBA does not call out bugs clearly when there are issues in the code. While trying to get the code to function there were multiple compile errors and empty arrays that needed to be corrected. While VBA is great since it can be used easily with Excel data, it can also be cumbersome due to how old it is.
